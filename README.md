# Welcome to SSPC-Clear-Sky-Model
The purpose of this GitHub is to complement the information presented in our research publication titled "An easy-to-calibrate DNI clear-sky model: a performance comparison in different geographic locations" published in the Journal <<Journal name>> and authored by C칠sar D. S치nchez-Segura and Manuel I. Pe침a-Cruz.

Our clear-sky model was compared against 13 clear-sky models using an 11-year database (2010-2020) that includes 71 solarimetric stations, showing high performance regardless of the type of climate and geographic characteristics. This model is calibrated using a couple of clear-sky instants. Detailed results can be found within this GitHub.
  
  
This GitHub contains the following impelled codes:
  - Extraction of Linke turbidity coefficient *TL* from SoDA images.
  - Processing of database configured for Pangaea nomenclature.
    - Approximation of the DNI curve under clear-sky conditions by SSPC and 13 other clear-sky models for each day of analysis. This process is performed for each solarimetric station.
    - Compilation of results per solarimetric station. 
  - Plotting of box plots.
All the code present in this GitHub was developed at 游눹 &nbsp; ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-333333?style=flat&logo=python)3.

  
The Python code available in this repository was written by Ce패sar D. Sa패nchez-Segura.

  
We obtained these input data from Pangaea database (https://www.pangaea.de/).
